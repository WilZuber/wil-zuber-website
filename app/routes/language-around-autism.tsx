          <p className="mt-4"> Autism research is prevalent. 
            It is crucially important that we understand the various language surrounding autism and autistic individuals, 
            and how that language impacts the autistic community.</p>

          <p className="mt-4"> There are generally two ways that we can refer to autistic individuals, person-first and identity-first. Even in the autistic community there is no 
            overwhelming consensus on which way is most preferred. Some individuals strongly prefer person-first and others strongly prefer identity-first. 
            Yet, other individuals may not have a strong preference one way or the other.
            It is important to consider the preference of the specific individuals that we are talking about when choosing what language to use. </p>

          <p className="mt-4"> It can be tricky though to know what language to use when not referring to specific individuals with known preferences. This article is meant to serve as a general guide on what each way of referring to autistic indviduals represent, as well as guidelines when navigating which term to use.</p>

          <h1 id='person-first' className='text-xl font-bold mt-4'>Person-first Language</h1>
          <p className='text-center'>“Person with autism” &mdash; “Child with autism” &mdash; “Diagnosed with autism”</p>
          <p> Person-first language places autism as something that a person has, rather than a core part of someone’s identity.
            Some individuals on the spectrum may prefer this language choice because they see themselves as separate from their autism.</p>

          <h1 id='identity-first' className='text-xl font-bold mt-4'>Identity-first Language</h1>
          <p className='text-center'>“Autistic person” &mdash; “Autistic child” &mdash; “Diagnosed as autistic”</p>
          <p> Identity-first language places autism as a core part of who someone is.
            Some individuals on the spectrum may prefer this language choice because they see autism as a core part of their identity.</p>

          <h1 id='human-avoidant' className='text-xl font-bold mt-4'>Human-Avoidant Language</h1>
          <p className='text-center'>"Autism Cases" &mdash; "ASD Cases" &mdash; "Prevalence of Autism"</p>
          <p>It can be tempting to leave these terms like "autistic person" or "person with autism" out altogether, opting to not refer to the individuals at all.
            While its okay to use abstract terms when referring to autism in the abstract (e.g. "The prevalence of autism"), it's important when conducting research with the aim to benefit autistic individuals that we center the human lives in the language that we use.
            Not only is this true because it may help researchers better align their work towards keeping autistic individuals in mind, but also because language use about groups of individuals can have a large impact on how they feel they are seen by the world especially by the scientific community.
